<p> A Deep Learning Framework for Multi-target Prediction </h3>

This is the official repository of DeepMTP, a deep learning framework that can be used with multi-target prediction (MTP) problems. MTP can be seen as an umbrella term that cover many subareas of machine learning, which include multi-label classification (MLC), multivariate regression (MTR), multi-task learning (MTL), dyadic prediction (DP), and matrix completion (MC). The implementation is mainly written in Python and uses Pytorch for the implementation of the neural network. The goal is for any user to be able to train a model using only a few lines of code.

### Latest Updates
- [1/6/2022] The first implementation of DeepMTP is now live!!!


## Background

## What is MTP??
Multi-target prediction (MTP) serves as an umbrella term for machine learning tasks that concern the simultaneous prediction of multiple target variables. These include:
* Multi-label Classification
* Multivariate Regression
* Multitask Learning
* Hierarchical Multi-label Classification
* Dyadic Prediction
* Zero-shot Learning
* Matrix Completion
* (Hybrid) Matrix Completion
* Cold-start Collaborative Filtering

Despite the significant similarities, all these domains have evolved separately into distinct research areas over the last two decades. To better understand these similarities and differences it is important to get accustomed to the terminology and main concepts used in this field.
